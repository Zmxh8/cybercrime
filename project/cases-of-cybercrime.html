                <p>In 2014, Yahoo became the victim of one of the biggest data breaches in history. Approximately 500 million accounts were hacked by a state-sponsored actor. Criminals were said to have stolen everything from names and email addresses to telephone numbers, passwords, and date of birth details, the theft was the biggest known cyber breach recorded at the time. </p> <br>
                <p> Although the attack officially took place in 2004, Yahoo only discovered the incursion after later reports were filed relating to a secondary breach. All the reports issued turned out to be false, but the investigation revealed significant details about the 2014 attack</p>
