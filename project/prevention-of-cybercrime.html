                <h2>Robust Cybersecurity Measures</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Implementing robust Cybersecurity measures is essential for protection against a wide range of Cyber threats Here are some key components...</p> <br>
                <p>1. Firewalls are important to implement to stay protected over the internet. Firewalls are network security devices that controls the incoming and outgoing of the network. The firewall acts as a barrier which follows predefined security rules. It is normally placed between the internal network and external network to help prevent malicious traffic and unauthorised accesss.  </p><br>
                <p>2. Antivirus software is important to implement into an organisation or individual's system. Antivirus scans files for malware patterns, helping to safeguard against cyber threats. Each Antivirus software has it's own features which should be considered when purchasing.</p>
           <p> Here are some examples of the best Antivirus Software: Norton Antivirus, McAfee Antivirus and Bitdefender Antivirus. </p><br>
           <p>3. Secure Email and Web Filtering should be applied for two different reasons. Implementing secure email filtering will help block malicious attachments, spam emails and malware filled URL's. Web filtering can prevent the user from accessing malicious websites, inappropiate content and suspicious downloads. These two methods of scanning are essential to help organisations against a wide range of cybercrime threats. </p>

                <h2>Strong Passwords And Authentication</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The use of Strong Passwords and Authentication is a key method to prevent the chances of Cybercrime. There are many factors to consider when making a password such as:</p> <br>
                <p>1. The Complexity: A stronger password includes having a combination of letters, uppercase or lowercase with numbers and special characters. However, you should also avoid using common words such as your name or birthday to avoid chances of the password being guessed.</p><br>
                <p>2. Multi Factor Authentication: Implementing this feature would add an extra layer of security when logging in. It requires users to provide additional information other than the password, an example is a one time code which can be sent to the user's email or number. Another example is using face ID or fingerprint recognition to validate your identity, to ensure the access is authorised. </p><br>
                <p>3. Account Lockout Policies: Implementing lockout's can help user's stay safe from attacks. It does this by locking the account, after 'x' amount of failed attempts, requiring the user to contact support and verify their identity. This would block out attackers and prevent excessive password attempts, improving the security and user convenience. </p>

                <h2>Data Protection Measures</h2>
                <br>
                <p>These are practices to protect sensitive data information from unauthorised access, altertion and destruction. The purpose of this is to keep confidentiality, intregity and availability of the data.</p> <br>
                <p>1.Data Backup and Recovery: Data back ups consists of creating copies of the data, files and applications on a regular basis. These backups can be done manually or automatically by using a backup software. There are 3 different backup types which can be used, full, incremental or differential. The key difference between these is full backups copies all the data whilst the incremental and differential backup only copies or changes new data since the last backup. </p><br>
                <p>2.User training and Awareness: Educating individuals and employees about data protection and privacy is important to improve security. By training and practicing, individuals will become familiar with recognising phishing patterns and other cyber threats.</p>
